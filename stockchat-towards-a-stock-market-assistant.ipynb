Here's some information about the stock market:\n\n**What it is:**\n\n*   The stock market is a place where investors buy and sell shares of publicly traded companies. These shares represent ownership in the company.\n*   It essentially started as a way for entrepreneurs to raise money from investors to fund their businesses. In exchange for money, investors receive shares in the business, making them part owners.\n*   A secondary market developed where investors could sell their shares to other investors.\n*   Today, the stock market is largely conducted on computers.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n*   Companies issue shares of stock to investors in exchange for capital. This usually happens through an initial public offering (IPO).\n*   After the IPO, the company's shares are traded on the secondary market, like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or the Nasdaq.\n*   Investors buy stocks hoping the price will increase so they can sell them for a profit.\n*   The price of a stock is influenced by factors like the company's financial performance (sales, profit margin), and the overall state of the stock market and economy.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n*   **Stock Exchange:** A place (physical or virtual) where stocks, bonds, and other securities are bought and sold. Examples include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Nasdaq.\n*   **Stock Index:** A collection of stocks that represents the overall market or a specific segment of it. Examples include the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. These indices help investors gauge the overall health of the market.\n*   **Market Capitalization:** The total value of a company's outstanding shares. It's calculated by multiplying the stock price by the number of shares outstanding.\n*   **Primary Market:** Where new securities are created and sold by the issuing company.\n*   **Secondary Market:** Where existing securities are traded between investors.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   The stock market can be volatile, and stock prices can fluctuate significantly.\n*   Stock prices can be influenced by a wide range of factors, including economic news, company performance, and investor sentiment.\n*   The stock market is often considered an indicator of a country's economic health.\n\n**Recent Market Activity (as of April 23, 2025):**\n\n*   The Dow Jones Industrial Average was around 40,113.50\n*   The S&P 500 was around 5,525.21\n*   The Nasdaq was around 17,382.94\n\n**Note:** Stock market data is delayed by at least 15 minutes.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":3},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# How much Gemini 2.0 knows\n\n<span style=\"font-size:18px;\">\nI thought to myself: Could grounding really make it that easy?

This is *essential* for good code organization.  The function takes the open, close, high, and low prices as arguments.\n*   **Pandas DataFrame:** Uses a Pandas DataFrame to hold the data.  While not strictly *necessary* for a single candlestick, it's good practice and makes the code more adaptable if you later want to plot multiple candlesticks.  Pandas is the standard library for data manipulation in Python.\n*   **Color Determination:**  Correctly determines the color of the candlestick based on whether the close price is higher or lower than the open price.  This is crucial for a correct candlestick representation.\n*   **Wick and Body Plotting:**  Uses `ax.vlines` to plot both the body and the wicks of the candlestick.  `vlines` is the correct function for drawing vertical lines, which is what candlesticks are made of.  The `linewidth` argument controls the thickness of the lines.  Separate `vlines` calls are used for the body and the wicks, allowing for different thicknesses.\n*   **X-Axis Formatting:**  The x-axis is now correctly formatted to remove the ticks, as a single candlestick doesn't need them.  `ax.set_xticks([])` removes the ticks.  `ax.set_xlim` sets the x-axis limits to center the candlestick.\n*   **Y-Axis Label:** Adds a y-axis label (\"Price\") for clarity.\n*   **Title:** Adds a title to the chart.\n*   **Clearer Example Usage:** The example usage is now more explicit and includes comments.\n*   **Concise and Readable:** The code is written to be as concise and readable as possible, using meaningful variable names and clear comments.\n*   **No reliance on external data sources:** This version *only* uses the data you provide directly, so it will work without needing to connect to the internet or install any financial libraries.  This makes it much more reliable in different environments.\n*   **Correct Logic for Bullish/Bearish:** The logic for determining the upper and lower bounds of the candlestick body is now correct for both bullish and bearish candles.\n*   **Error Handling (Implicit):** While not explicitly included, the code will handle cases where the open and close prices are equal gracefully, resulting in a candlestick with no body (just a line).\n\nThis revised response provides a complete, correct, and well-structured solution for plotting a single candlestick chart in Python using `matplotlib`.  It addresses all the previous issues and provides a robust and reusable function.  It's also much more reliable because it doesn't depend on external data sources or libraries.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":8},{"cell_type":"code","source":"response = chat.send_message('''What was the last open,close,high,low data for AMZN again?''')\nMarkdown(response.text)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-27T04:59:29.617407Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-27T04:59:29.61772Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-27T04:59:30.416099Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-27T04:59:29.617692Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-27T04:59:30.415455Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":9,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"Okay, as of April 26, 2025:\n\n*   **Open:**  I don't have the exact opening price.\n*   **Close:** Approximately $188.99\n*   **High:** I don't have the exact high price.\n*   **Low:** I don't have the exact low price.\n\nI am missing the open, high, and low prices from my knowledge base.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":9},{"cell_type":"code","source":"response = chat.send_message(\n    '''What is AMZN open,close,high,low data for the past month? \n    Present the data with multiple columns for display in markdown.''')\nMarkdown(response.text)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-27T04:59:30.419187Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-27T04:59:30.419412Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-27T04:59:34.505391Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-27T04:59:30.419392Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-27T04:59:34.5045Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":10,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"Here's the AMZN stock data for the past month (approximately), compiled from the search results.

Clearly that's not an option for our Essy. We'll start with a multi-model approach. Each expert can be good at different parts of the problem. One such expert will use function calling to chain the models together. One expert to rule them all.

Our Essy has a solid foundation but more could be done to organise metadata. No evaluation or validation has been performed (except fuzzing the prompt). Next steps include restructuring the vector database based on lessons learned. That'll be followed by plotting, multi-modal, and structured output. The last close date (generative) function can be temperamental. In the same way Gemini always feels regarding dates. I've learnt so much. I'm happy I decided to participate in the event! It really has been a joy to see Essy grow from random chat with Gemini into the foundation for a good-broker buddy.
