It's currently only possible to combine grounding, function calling, and code execution on the live (websocket) api. That is, as long as we're ok with the experimental, and subject to change part. Clearly that's not an option for our Essy. We'll start with a multi-model approach. Each expert can be good at different parts of the problem. One such expert will use function calling to chain the models together. One expert to rule them all. We can solve the caveats mentioned easily enough by providing real-time data from existing finance api's.

We'll use the popular Chroma and build a RAG expert to begin. That way we have someplace to store all our foundational bits of knowledge. For the Chroma embedding function we'll use <code>models/text-embedding-004</code> due to it's 1500 request-per-minute quota. We'll need to be mindful of the smaller 2,048 token input.

Our Essy has a solid foundation but more could be done to organise metadata. No evaluation or validation has been performed (except fuzzing the prompt). Next steps include restructuring the vector database based on lessons learned. That'll be followed by plotting, multi-modal, and structured output. The last close date (generative) function can be temperamental. In the same way Gemini always feels regarding dates. I've learnt so much. I'm happy I decided to participate in the event! It really has been a joy to see Essy grow from random chat with Gemini into the foundation for a good-broker buddy.
