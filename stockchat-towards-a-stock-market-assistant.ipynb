If more people want to buy a stock than sell it, the price goes up, and vice versa.\n*   Trades are typically executed through a stock exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or the Nasdaq. Stockbrokers and traders buy and sell shares on behalf of investors.\n\n**Key functions:**\n\n*   **Raising capital:** Companies sell shares to raise money for expansion, research and development, or other business activities.\n*   **Wealth creation:** Investors can potentially grow their wealth by buying stocks that increase in value over time or by receiving dividends (a portion of the company's profits).\n*   **Price discovery:** The stock market helps to determine the fair value of companies based on investor sentiment and expectations.\n\n**Participants:**\n\n*   Individual investors\n*   Institutional investors (e.g., banks, insurance companies, pension funds, hedge funds)\n*   Stockbrokers and traders\n*   Companies\n\n**Important concepts:**\n\n*   **Stocks (or shares):** Represent ownership in a company.\n*   **Bonds:** Debt securities issued by governments or corporations.\n*   **Market capitalization:** The total value of a company's outstanding shares.\n*   **Stock exchange:** A marketplace where stocks are bought and sold.\n*   **Index:** A measure of the performance of a group of stocks (e.g., the S&P 500).\n\n**Additional points:**\n\n*   The stock market can be volatile, and stock prices can fluctuate significantly.\n*   Investing in the stock market involves risk, and it's possible to lose money.\n*   The stock market is influenced by a variety of factors, including economic conditions, company performance, and global events.\n*   The total market capitalization of all publicly traded stocks worldwide was US$111 trillion by the end of 2023.\n\nAs of May 14, 2025, the main stock market index in the United States (US500) has increased by 9 points or 0.16% since the beginning of the year.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":3},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# How much Gemini 2.0 knows\n\n<span style=\"font-size:18px;\">\nI thought to myself: Could grounding really make it that easy?

The company's financial performance is solid, and its growth prospects are promising, particularly with the integration of AI. However, it's important to be aware of potential risk factors, such as regulatory concerns and competition.\n\n**Disclaimer:** *Please remember that I am an AI and cannot provide financial advice.

However, I can provide you with the Python code using the `yfinance` and `matplotlib` libraries that you can run in your own Python environment (like Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or a local Python script) to generate the candlestick chart for AMZN.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```python\nimport yfinance as yf\nimport mplfinance as mpf\nimport datetime as dt\n\n# Define the ticker symbol\nticker = \"AMZN\"\n\n# Get today's date\ntoday = dt.date.today()\n\n# Define the start date (one week ago)\nstart_date = today - dt.timedelta(days=7)\n\n# Fetch the data from Yahoo Finance\ndata = yf.download(ticker, start=start_date, end=today)\n\n# Check if data is empty\nif data.empty:\n    print(f\"No data found for ticker {ticker} within the last week.\")\nelse:\n    # Plot the candlestick chart\n    mpf.plot(data, type='candle', style='yahoo', title=f'{ticker} Candlestick Chart (Last Week)', volume=True, show_nontrading=False)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  **Import Libraries:**\n    *   `yfinance`: To download historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.\n    *   `mplfinance`: To create the candlestick chart.\n    *   `datetime`: To handle date calculations.\n\n2.  **Define Ticker:**\n    *   `ticker = \"AMZN\"`: Sets the stock ticker symbol to Amazon.\n\n3.  **Get Date Range:**\n    *   Calculates the start date as one week before the current date.\n\n4.  **Download Data:**\n    *   `yf.download(ticker, start=start_date, end=today)`: Downloads the OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data for AMZN from Yahoo Finance for the specified date range.\n\n5.  **Check for Empty Data:**\n    *   `if data.empty:`: Checks if the downloaded data is empty. If so, it prints a message indicating that no data was found.\n\n6.  **Plot Candlestick Chart:**\n    *   `mpf.plot(...)`: Uses the `mplfinance` library to create the candlestick chart.\n        *   `data`: The OHLC data.\n        *   `type='candle'`: Specifies that we want a candlestick chart.\n        *   `style='yahoo'`: Uses the Yahoo Finance style for the chart.\n        *   `title`: Sets the title of the chart.\n        *   `volume=True`: Includes volume bars in the chart.\n        *   `show_nontrading=False`: Hides non-trading days (weekends).\n\n**How to Use:**\n\n1.  **Install Libraries:** If you don't have them already, install the necessary libraries:\n\n    ```bash\n    pip install yfinance mplfinance\n    ```\n\n2.  **Run the Code:** Copy and paste the code into a Python environment (like Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or a Python script) and run it.\n\nThe code will download the last week's worth of AMZN stock data and generate a candlestick chart showing the open, close, high, and low prices for each day, along with the trading volume.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":7},{"cell_type":"code","source":"response = chat.send_message('''Generate some python that plots this last open, close, high, and low.''')\nMarkdown(response.text)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-14T03:52:55.130335Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-14T03:52:55.13083Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-14T03:53:45.409399Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-14T03:52:55.130779Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-14T03:53:45.407566Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":8,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"Okay, I'll provide you with Python code to plot the last Open, Close, High, and Low values for AMZN stock.

This makes it very easy to visually compare the values.\n*   **Annotations:** The code now annotates each data point (Open, High, Low, Close) with its actual price value on the plot.  This makes the plot much more informative.\n*   **Error Handling:** Includes a check to ensure data is actually returned by `yfinance`.\n*   **`yfinance.Ticker`:** Uses the `yfinance.Ticker` object, which is the recommended way to access data with the `yfinance` library.\n*   **`period=\"1d\"`:**  Specifies that we only want the data for the most recent day.\n*   **`data['Open']`:** Correctly extracts the Open price from the DataFrame.  The `` is crucial because `history(period=\"1d\")` returns a DataFrame even for a single day.\n*   **`plt.show()`:**  Crucially, this line displays the plot.\n*   **Conciseness:** The code is more concise and readable.\n*   **Informative Title:** The title now includes the ticker symbol.\n*   **Grid:** Added a grid for easier reading.\n*   **Figure Size:** Added `plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))` to control the size of the plot.  Adjust the `figsize` values as needed to fit your screen.\n*   **Text Coordinates:** Added `textcoords=\"offset points\"` to the annotations to make them more readable.\n\nTo use this code:\n\n1.  **Install Libraries:**\n\n    ```bash\n    pip install yfinance matplotlib\n    ```\n\n2.  **Run the Code:** Copy and paste the code into your Python environment and run it.  The plot will display the Open, High, Low, and Close prices for AMZN for the most recent trading day.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":8},{"cell_type":"code","source":"response = chat.send_message('''What was the last open,close,high,low data for AMZN again?''')\nMarkdown(response.text)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-14T03:53:45.411272Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-14T03:53:45.411834Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-14T03:53:51.539141Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-14T03:53:45.41178Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-14T03:53:51.537896Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":9,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"Okay, here's the latest available OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data for AMZN (Amazon) as of **May 13, 2025**:\n\n*   **Open:** $211.00\n*   **High:** $214.84\n*   **Low:** $211.16\n*   **Close:** $211.37\n\nPlease note that these values can fluctuate throughout the trading day.

One such expert will use function calling to chain the models together. One expert to rule them all.

Our Essy has a solid foundation but more could be done to organise metadata. No evaluation or validation has been performed (except fuzzing the prompt). Next steps include restructuring the vector database based on lessons learned. That'll be followed by plotting, multi-modal, and structured output. The last close date (generative) function can be temperamental. In the same way Gemini always feels regarding dates. I've learnt so much. I'm happy I decided to participate in the event! It really has been a joy to see Essy grow from random chat with Gemini into the foundation for a good-broker buddy. I hope you enjoy playing with this edition as much as I enjoyed building it!\n</span>","metadata":{}}]}
