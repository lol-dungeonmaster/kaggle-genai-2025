It includes both exchanges and over-the-counter (OTC) marketplaces.\n*   Stocks represent ownership in a company. When you buy a company's stock, you're buying a share of ownership in that business.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n*   Companies can raise money by issuing shares of stock on an exchange through an initial public offering (IPO).\n*   Investors purchase these shares, providing the company with capital to grow its business.\n*   After the IPO, investors can trade stocks with each other.\n*   The price of a stock is determined by supply and demand, as buyers and sellers negotiate prices.\n\n**Purpose of the stock market:**\n\n*   The stock market provides a place for companies to raise capital for expansion.\n*   It allows investors to buy and sell ownership in publicly traded companies.\n*   It provides liquidity for investors, making it easier to sell securities.\n\n**Key components:**\n\n*   **Exchanges:** These are central locations where buyers and sellers meet to trade stocks. Examples include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Nasdaq.\n*   **Stockbrokers and traders:** They buy and sell shares on behalf of investors.\n*   **Stock market indexes:** These are used to measure the performance of the stock market as a whole, or a specific segment of it.\n\n**Factors that influence stock prices:**\n\n*   Company performance, such as revenue growth and profit margins.\n*   The overall state of the stock market and the economy.\n*   Investor sentiment and expectations.\n\nKeep in mind that the stock market can be volatile, and investments can go down as well as up.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":3},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# How much Gemini 2.0 knows\n\n<span style=\"font-size:18px;\">\nI thought to myself: Could grounding really make it that easy?

However, Apple has been taking steps to mitigate the impact, such as building up inventory and shifting production to other countries.\n*   **AI:** There are reports of Apple delaying the rollout of AI features for future iPhones, which has led to some analysts cutting their price target for the stock.

While the company faces some challenges, it is taking steps to mitigate the impact and is expected to benefit from the growing demand for AI and its strong position in the premium hardware sector. However, investors should be aware of the potential risks and uncertainties.

Our Essy has a solid foundation but more could be done to organise metadata. No evaluation or validation has been performed (except fuzzing the prompt). Next steps include restructuring the vector database based on lessons learned. That'll be followed by plotting, multi-modal, and structured output. The last close date (generative) function can be temperamental. In the same way Gemini always feels regarding dates. I've learnt so much. I'm happy I decided to participate in the event! It really has been a joy to see Essy grow from random chat with Gemini into the foundation for a good-broker buddy. I hope you enjoy playing with this edition as much as I enjoyed building it!\n</span>","metadata":{}}]}
