It is also called an exchange mechanism that helps investors buy and sell shares in publicly traded companies.\n*   It's a crucial part of modern economies, facilitating the movement of money between investors and companies.\n*   The stock market consists of exchanges and venues where shares are traded. Examples include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the NASDAQ, though trading is primarily electronic.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n*   **Companies raise capital:** Businesses can raise money by selling shares of their company on the stock market.\n*   **Investors buy and sell shares:** Investors and traders buy and sell these stocks, and these trades determine the stock prices.\n*   **Supply and demand:** Stock prices reflect the company's perceived value and overall market conditions, influenced by supply and demand.\n*   **Secondary Market:** After a company goes public, stocks are traded freely between investors, which is known as the secondary market.\n\n**Key functions:**\n\n*   **Capital Formation:** It enables companies to raise capital from investors.\n*   **Wealth Creation:** It provides a platform for investors to grow their wealth.\n*   **Price Discovery: **The stock market determines stock prices through trading activities, reflecting a company's perceived value.\n\n**Participants:**\n\n*   The stock market includes small individual stock investors to larger investors, who can be based anywhere in the world, and may include banks, insurance companies, pension funds and hedge funds.\n\n**Important concepts:**\n\n*   **Stock Exchanges:** These are organized and regulated places (now often virtual) where stocks and other securities are bought and sold.\n*   **Market Capitalization:** This refers to the total value of a company's outstanding shares.\n*   **Primary Market:** Where financial assets are created and sold directly by the issuer.\n*   **Secondary Market:** Where existing financial assets are traded.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":3},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# How much Gemini 2.0 knows\n\n<span style=\"font-size:18px;\">\nI thought to myself: Could grounding really make it that easy?

The month change is a -10.24% fall, and over the last year, it has shown a -2.13% decrease.\n*   **Market Capitalization:** Amazon has a market capitalization of approximately $1.78 trillion.\n*   **Earnings:** Amazon's last quarter earnings were $1.86 per share, exceeding estimates. The next earnings report is expected on May 1, 2025, with an estimated earnings of $1.36 per share.\n\n**Analyst Ratings and Price Targets:**\n\n*   **Consensus:** The consensus rating for AMZN stock is a \"Strong Buy.\"\n*   **Average Price Target:** The average 12-month price target from analysts is around $253.33, suggesting a potential increase of over 46% from the current price.

Tariffs on Chinese goods could impact Amazon's earnings, as a significant portion of its gross merchandise value is exposed to China.\n*   **Investments:** Amazon is making significant investments in areas like AI and its AWS cloud services, which could affect profitability in the short term but are expected to drive long-term growth. They plan to spend over $100 billion in capital expenditures in 2025.\n*   **AWS Growth:** Demand for AWS is surging due to customers wanting to implement AI applications.\n*   **E-commerce:** While e-commerce faces challenges, Amazon's high-margin segments like AWS, subscriptions, and ad services are driving profitability.\n*   **Analyst Downgrades:** Recently, some analysts have downgraded Amazon stock or cut price targets due to concerns about tariffs and near-term profitability.\n\n**Potential Concerns:**\n\n*   **Slowing Profit Growth:** Some analysts foresee a slowdown in Amazon's profit growth in 2025.\n*   **Technical Indicators:** Some technical indicators suggest a potential downtrend in the stock price.\n*   **Market Volatility:** General market conditions and economic uncertainty can also impact the stock price.\n\n**General Sentiment:**\n\n*   Despite some concerns, many analysts remain optimistic about Amazon's long-term growth potential, citing its dominance in e-commerce, the growth of AWS, and its investments in AI.\n*   Some analysts believe that the recent dip in the stock price could be a good buying opportunity.\n\n**Important upcoming date:**\n\n*   Amazon is going to release the next earnings report on May 1, 2025.\n\n**Disclaimer:** *This is not financial advice.

This is crucial for any plotting task you might want to repeat.\n*   **Color-Coded Candles:** The code now correctly colors the candlestick body green for bullish (closing price higher than opening price) and red for bearish (closing price lower than opening price) scenarios.\n*   **Clear Comments:**  I've added comments to explain each step of the plotting process.\n*   **No reliance on external data:** This version takes the OHLC values directly as arguments, so it doesn't need to fetch data from an external source.  This makes it runnable as is.\n*   **Corrected `ax.bar` Usage:** The `ax.bar` function is used correctly to draw the body of the candlestick.  The `bottom` argument is essential to position the bar correctly.\n*   **Wick Plotting:** The `ax.vlines` function is used to draw the wicks, representing the high and low prices.\n*   **Y-Axis Formatting:** The y-axis is formatted to display prices with two decimal places and a dollar sign.\n*   **Clear Title and Labels:** The plot has a title and y-axis label for clarity.  The x-axis ticks are removed since we're only plotting a single candlestick.\n*   **Plot Limit Adjustment:** The code now includes padding around the high and low prices to prevent the candlestick from touching the edges of the plot, making it more visually appealing.  The `padding` variable can be adjusted to control the amount of space.\n*   **Example Usage:** The code includes an example of how to use the `candlestick_plot` function with sample data.  *Remember to replace these with your actual data.*\n*   **Error Handling (Important Consideration):**  While this code *directly* addresses the plotting request, a robust solution would include error handling (e.g., `try...except` blocks) to gracefully handle cases where the input data is invalid (e.g., `high_price` is less than `low_price`).\n\nThis revised response provides a complete, correct, and well-explained solution for generating a candlestick plot from a single set of OHLC data points using `matplotlib`.

It's currently only possible to combine grounding, function calling, and code execution on the live (websocket) api. That is, as long as we're ok with the experimental, and subject to change part. Clearly that's not an option for our Essy. We'll start with a multi-model approach. Each expert can be good at different parts of the problem. One such expert will use function calling to chain the models together. One expert to rule them all. We can solve the caveats mentioned easily enough by providing real-time data from existing finance api's.

We'll use the popular Chroma and build a RAG expert to begin. That way we have someplace to store all our foundational bits of knowledge. For the Chroma embedding function we'll use <code>models/text-embedding-004</code> due to it's 1500 request-per-minute quota. We'll need to be mindful of the smaller 2,048 token input.

Our Essy has a solid foundation but more could be done to organise metadata. No evaluation or validation has been performed (except fuzzing the prompt). Next steps include restructuring the vector database based on lessons learned. That'll be followed by plotting, multi-modal, and structured output. The last close date (generative) function can be temperamental. In the same way Gemini always feels regarding dates. I've learnt so much. I'm happy I decided to participate in the event! It really has been a joy to see Essy grow from random chat with Gemini into the foundation for a good-broker buddy. I hope you enjoy playing with this edition as much as I enjoyed building it!\n</span>","metadata":{}}]}
