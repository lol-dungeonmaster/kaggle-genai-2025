It's also known as the equity market or share market.\n*   The stock market allows companies to raise money by selling shares to investors.\n*   Investors can then buy and sell these shares among themselves.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n*   **Primary Market:** Companies issue new shares to raise capital through an Initial Public Offering (IPO).\n*   **Secondary Market:** Investors trade existing shares with each other. The majority of stock trading takes place on exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Nasdaq.\n*   The price of a stock is determined by supply and demand. If more investors want to buy a stock than sell it, the price goes up, and vice versa.\n\n**Participants:**\n\n*   The stock market includes a wide range of participants, from individual investors to large institutions like banks, insurance companies, pension funds, and hedge funds.\n\n**Function and Purpose:**\n\n*   **Raising Capital:** It's a crucial way for companies to raise funds for expansion.\n*   **Liquidity:** Stock markets provide liquidity for investors, enabling them to easily buy and sell securities.\n*   **Investment:** It allows investors to participate in the growth of companies and potentially generate returns.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n*   **Stock Exchange:** A place (physical or virtual) where stocks are bought and sold. Examples include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Nasdaq.\n*   **Stock Index:** A benchmark that tracks the performance of a group of stocks, representing the overall market or a specific sector. Examples include the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n*   **Shares:** Represent ownership in a company. In exchange for money, companies issue shares, or stock, to investors.\n\n**Factors that Influence Stock Prices:**\n\n*   Company performance (e.g., revenue growth, earnings)\n*   Economic conditions\n*   Investor sentiment\n*   Global events\n\n**Recent Market Activity:**\n\n*   Indian equity indices Sensex and Nifty traded higher.\n*   The main stock market index in the United States (US500) has decreased since the beginning of 2025.\n*   The FTSE 100 in London is up.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":3},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# How much Gemini 2.0 knows\n\n<span style=\"font-size:18px;\">\nI thought to myself: Could grounding really make it that easy?

It tells `yfinance` to only download the data for the most recent day.  This makes the code much more efficient and ensures you're only working with the data you need.\n*   **`iloc`:**  Since we're only getting one day's worth of data, we use `.iloc` to access the first (and only) element of each column (Open, High, Low, Close).\n*   **Clearer Candlestick Logic:** The code now correctly determines the color of the candlestick based on whether the closing price is higher or lower than the opening price.\n*   **Wick and Body:** The candlestick is constructed with a wick (the vertical line representing the high and low) and a body (the colored rectangle representing the difference between open and close).\n*   **Error Handling:** Includes a `try...except` block to catch potential errors, such as an invalid ticker symbol.\n*   **No X-Axis Ticks:**  Since we're only plotting one candlestick, the x-axis is not meaningful, so `plt.xticks([])` removes the ticks.\n*   **Conciseness:** The code is more concise and readable.\n\nTo use this code:\n\n1.  **Install Libraries:**  Make sure you have `yfinance` and `matplotlib` installed:\n\n```bash\npip install yfinance matplotlib\n```\n\n2.  **Copy and Paste:** Copy the code into your Python environment.\n3.  **Run the Code:** Execute the Python code.  A candlestick chart for the last day's trading of the specified stock will be displayed.\n\nThis revised response provides a complete, correct, and runnable solution to the user's request.

bearish predictions and recommendation trends, incorporating short-term trends and sentiment analysis from recent news:\n\n**Analyst Recommendations:**\n\n*   The latest analyst recommendation trends from May 1, 2025, show a strong bullish sentiment:\n    *   Strong Buy: 22\n    *   Buy: 51\n    *   Hold: 6\n    *   Sell: 0\n    *   Strong Sell: 0\n*   Recommendation trends have remained consistently positive over the past few months, with a majority of analysts rating Amazon as a \"Buy\" or \"Strong Buy.\"\n\n**News Sentiment and Short-Term Trends:**\n\n*   Recent news articles reflect a mixed sentiment, with both positive and negative factors influencing Amazon's outlook.\n*   **Positive Factors:**\n    *   Amazon Web Services (AWS) continues to be a strong growth driver, particularly with the increasing demand for cloud computing infrastructure driven by the AI revolution.\n    *   Amazon is considered a leader in AI, with significant investments in AI infrastructure and services.\n    *   Analysts believe Amazon is well-positioned for long-term growth due to its dominance in e-commerce, cloud services, and AI.\n    *   Some analysts predict that Amazon could surpass Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple in market valuation within the next 5 years.\n    *   Members of Congress have been buying Amazon stock, indicating confidence in the company's future.\n*   **Negative Factors:**\n    *   Concerns about the impact of tariffs on Amazon's e-commerce business persist, potentially leading to higher prices for consumers and reduced sales.\n    *   Some analysts have downgraded Amazon's stock and lowered the price target due to concerns about macroeconomic headwinds and tariffs.\n    *   There are concerns about a potential slowdown in AI infrastructure demand, which could impact Amazon's AWS business.\n    *   The S&P 500 is experiencing high concentration levels, with the top 10 stocks, including Amazon, underperforming the index.\n*   **Short-Term Trends:**\n    *   The stock market may see significant volatility this week due to key earnings reports from major tech companies like Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft, as well as economic data releases on jobs, GDP, and consumer spending.\n    *   Amazon's upcoming earnings report will be closely watched as investors assess the impact of US sanctions and tariffs on the company\\'s business.\n    *   Amazon stock has fallen 14% in 2025 amid concerns about the impact of new tariffs.\n\n**Concise Summary:**\n\nAmazon's recommendation trends remain strongly bullish, with a significant majority of analysts rating the stock as a \"Buy\" or \"Strong Buy.\" However, recent news sentiment is mixed, with positive factors such as the strength of AWS and Amazon's leadership in AI being offset by concerns about tariffs and potential economic headwinds. Short-term trends suggest that the stock market may see volatility in the coming week due to key earnings reports and economic data releases.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":24},{"cell_type":"code","source":"send_message(\"What is Google's stock ticker symbol?\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-05T06:38:05.817483Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-05T06:38:05.817879Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-05T06:38:11.995446Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-05T06:38:05.817829Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-05T06:38:11.994596Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"Score similarity to query: 100%|██████████| 11/11 [00:00<00:00, 16.78it/s]\n","output_type":"stream"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"#### Natural language response"},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"Google's stock ticker symbols on the NASDAQ are GOOGL and GOOG.

Our Essy has a solid foundation but more could be done to organise metadata. No evaluation or validation has been performed (except fuzzing the prompt). Next steps include restructuring the vector database based on lessons learned. That'll be followed by plotting, multi-modal, and structured output. The last close date (generative) function can be temperamental. In the same way Gemini always feels regarding dates. I've learnt so much. I'm happy I decided to participate in the event! It really has been a joy to see Essy grow from random chat with Gemini into the foundation for a good-broker buddy.
