Here's some information about the stock market:\n\n*   **Definition:** The stock market is a network of exchanges where stocks and other securities are bought and sold. It includes both exchanges and over-the-counter (OTC) marketplaces where investors trade directly with each other.\n*   **Function:** The stock market allows companies to raise money by issuing shares of ownership (stocks) to investors. It provides a place for investors to buy and sell these shares, offering liquidity and enabling companies to be publicly traded.\n*   **How it works:** Companies list shares on an exchange through an initial public offering (IPO). Investors purchase these shares, providing capital for the company. Subsequently, investors can trade these stocks among themselves. The price of a stock is determined by supply and demand, with buyers offering bids and sellers asking for a certain price.\n*   **Participants:** The stock market involves a wide range of participants, from individual investors to large institutions like banks, insurance companies, pension funds, and hedge funds.\n*   **Stock Exchanges:** A stock exchange is where stockbrokers and traders can buy and sell shares, bonds, and other securities. Examples include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Nasdaq.\n*   **Stock Market Indexes:** Stock market indexes track the performance of a group of stocks to represent the overall market or a specific segment. These indexes help investors understand how their stocks are performing relative to the market. As of today, May 4, 2025, the main stock market index in the United States (US500) has decreased by 3.31% since the beginning of the year.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":3},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# How much Gemini 2.0 knows\n\n<span style=\"font-size:18px;\">\nI thought to myself: Could grounding really make it that easy?

The original `mplfinance` library has changed significantly.  This ensures the code works as intended with the candlestick plotting function.  If you have the new `mplfinance` installed, you'll need to either downgrade or adapt the code to the new API (which is significantly different).\n*   **Pandas DataFrame:** Uses a Pandas DataFrame to store the data, which is the standard way to work with time series data in Python.\n*   **No Hardcoded Data:**  The code *fetches* the data directly from Yahoo Finance using `yfinance`.  This makes it much more useful.\n*   **Conciseness:** Combines some steps for more concise code where appropriate.\n\nTo use this code:\n\n1.  **Install Libraries:**  If you don't have them already, install the necessary libraries:\n\n    ```bash\n    pip install yfinance matplotlib mplfinance pandas\n    ```\n\n2.  **Run the Code:** Copy and paste the code into a Python environment (like a Jupyter Notebook or a Python script) and run it.\n\n3.  **Adjust Dates:**  Modify the `start_date` and `end_date` variables to specify the date range you want to plot.\n\nThis will generate a candlestick chart showing the open, high, low, and close prices for AMZN (or any other ticker you specify) over the given time period.

This is the *most important* step.  You'll likely get these values from a data source like `yfinance` or another API.\n\n3.  **Run the Code:**  Execute the Python code.  It will generate a candlestick chart for the single data point you provided.\n\nImportant Considerations:\n\n*   **Real-Time Data:**  To plot real-time data, you'll need to integrate this code with a data source that provides live stock prices.  The previous example using `yfinance` shows how to fetch historical data, and you can adapt it to fetch the latest data point.\n*   **Error Handling:**  Add error handling (using `try...except`) to gracefully handle cases where data is not available or there are issues with the data source.\n*   **Dynamic Updates:**  If you want to create a continuously updating chart, you'll need to use a more advanced plotting technique that allows you to update the chart in real-time (e.g., using `matplotlib.animation`).\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":8},{"cell_type":"code","source":"response = chat.send_message('''What was the last open,close,high,low data for AMZN again?''')\nMarkdown(response.text)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-04T08:02:30.640614Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-04T08:02:30.6413Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-04T08:02:32.661167Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-04T08:02:30.641255Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-04T08:02:32.660165Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":9,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"The last available Open, High, Low, and Close data for AMZN (Amazon) is from **May 2, 2025**:\n\n*   **Open:** \\$191.435 or $191.64\n*   **High:** \\$192.88\n*   **Low:** \\$186.40\n*   **Close:** \\$189.98 or $189.82\n\nNote there may be slight differences in the open and closing prices between sources.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":9},{"cell_type":"code","source":"response = chat.send_message(\n    '''What is AMZN open,close,high,low data for the past month? \n    Present the data with multiple columns for display in markdown.''')\nMarkdown(response.text)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-04T08:02:32.662486Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-04T08:02:32.662859Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-04T08:02:47.789387Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-04T08:02:32.662826Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-04T08:02:47.788276Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":10,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"Okay, here's the AMZN (Amazon) Open, High, Low, and Close data for the past month (April 4, 2025, to May 3, 2025), presented in a Markdown table.

Clearly that's not an option for our Essy. We'll start with a multi-model approach. Each expert can be good at different parts of the problem. One such expert will use function calling to chain the models together. One expert to rule them all.

Our Essy has a solid foundation but more could be done to organise metadata. No evaluation or validation has been performed (except fuzzing the prompt). Next steps include restructuring the vector database based on lessons learned. That'll be followed by plotting, multi-modal, and structured output. The last close date (generative) function can be temperamental. In the same way Gemini always feels regarding dates. I've learnt so much. I'm happy I decided to participate in the event! It really has been a joy to see Essy grow from random chat with Gemini into the foundation for a good-broker buddy.
