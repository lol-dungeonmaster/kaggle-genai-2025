The difference is called the bid-ask spread.\n5.  **Supply and demand:** Each exchange tracks the supply and demand of stocks listed there.\n\n**Purpose:**\n\n*   The stock market provides a place where people can buy and sell fractional ownership in publicly traded companies.\n*   It distributes control of some of the world's largest companies among many individual investors.\n*   The buying and selling decisions of investors determine the value of those companies.\n*   The market lets buyers and sellers negotiate prices, which aims to maximize fairness for both parties.\n\n**Participants:**\n\n*   Small individual stock investors\n*   Larger investors like banks, insurance companies, pension funds, and hedge funds.\n\n**Key concepts:**\n\n*   **Equities (stocks or shares):** Represent an ownership interest in a company.\n*   **Stock exchange:** A place where stockbrokers and traders can buy and sell shares, bonds, and other securities.\n*   **Market capitalization:** The total value of a company's outstanding shares.\n*   **Primary market:** Where financial assets are created and sold directly by the issuer.\n*   **Secondary market:** Where existing financial assets are traded.\n\n**Important Note:** The stock market can be complex, and it's important to do your research and understand the risks involved before investing.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":24},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# How much Gemini 2.0 knows\n\n<span style=\"font-size:18px;\">\nI thought to myself: Could grounding really make it that easy?

Over the last year, Amazon.com has shown a 2.54% increase.\n*   **Market Volatility:** AMZN stock is 2.36% volatile and has a beta coefficient of 1.39.\n\n**Price Targets & Forecasts:**\n\n*   **12-Month Price Targets:** Based on recent analysis, the average price target is around $245.33, with a high forecast of $287.00 and a low of $195.00.\n*   **Upside Potential:** The average price target represents a potential increase of around 30.70% from the current price.\n*   **Forecasts for 2025:**\n    *   Some forecasts predict AMZN will trade between $168.74 and $198.47 in 2025, averaging around $181.41.\n    *   Another source forecasts a maximum price of $201 and a minimum of $161 for April 2025, with a predicted price of $186 at the end of the month.\n*   **Long-Term Potential:** One analysis suggests the stock price could double in five years, potentially reaching the high $400s, assuming no major economic downturn.\n\n**Factors to Consider:**\n\n*   **Earnings:** Amazon is scheduled to release its next earnings report soon. Analysts expect revenue and profits to increase.\n*   **AI Spending:** Amazon's plans to keep up with spending on artificial intelligence are being closely watched.\n*   **Tariffs:** The potential impact of tariffs on Amazon's business is a concern for some analysts, as they could hurt profit margins and advertising revenue.\n*   **Economic Conditions:** A global economic downturn could negatively impact Amazon's business.\n\n**Key Points from Recent News:**\n\n*   UBS analysts recently cut Amazon's price target, citing slower growth in gross merchandise volumes due to tariff-driven price hikes.\n*   Analysts will likely seek more information about Amazon's plans to keep up with the spending pace of its artificial intelligence rivals.\n*   Oppenheimer cut its target price for Amazon stock by 15% due to concerns that tariffs will likely lead to lower profit margins.\n*   UPS is cutting jobs and closing buildings, partly due to lower Amazon volumes.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThe outlook for AMZN stock appears generally positive, with many analysts rating it as a \"Strong Buy\" and predicting significant upside potential.

It takes the OHLC values as arguments.\n*   **Single-Day Data:**  The code is specifically designed to plot *one* candlestick representing the last day's data.\n*   **`datetime.date.today()`:**  Uses the current date for the x-axis, making the chart more informative.  The `mdates.date2num` function converts the date to a numerical format that `matplotlib` can use.\n*   **Example Usage:**  The example usage section is included to show how to call the function with sample data.  **You MUST replace this sample data with your actual stock data.**\n*   **Ticker Symbol:**  The `ticker_symbol` is now a parameter, allowing you to easily set the chart title.\n*   **Error Handling (Removed):**  I removed the `try...except` block because, in this simplified version, there's less that can go wrong.  If you're using real data from `yfinance`, you should add error handling back in.\n*   **Conciseness:** The code is streamlined to focus on the core task of plotting the candlestick.\n\nTo use this code:\n\n1.  **Install Libraries:** Make sure you have `matplotlib` and `mplfinance` installed (`pip install matplotlib mplfinance`).\n2.  **Replace Placeholder Data:**  **Crucially, replace the `open_price`, `high_price`, `low_price`, `close_price`, and `ticker` variables with the *actual* last day's OHLC data for the stock you're interested in.**  You would typically get this data from a financial API like `yfinance`.\n3.  **Run the Code:** Execute the Python script.

In April 2025, there were 23 strong buy, 50 buy, and 4 hold recommendations. There were no sell or strong sell recommendations.

Some analysts predict Amazon could surpass the market valuations of Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple within the next 5 years. The company's diversified revenue model and profitability outlook are also seen as positives. Some articles note that members of Congress have been buying Amazon stock, indicating confidence in the company's prospects.\n*   **Negative Sentiments:** Concerns exist regarding the potential impact of tariffs on Amazon's business, which could lead to higher prices and reduced consumer appeal.

the impact of tariffs, and consumers are rushing to buy iPhones before potential price hikes.\n    *   Apple relies heavily on Chinese manufacturing for most of its products, placing it squarely in the crosshairs of ongoing trade tensions.\n    *   Apple has received a temporary exemption from tariffs on its electronics, providing some relief.\n    *   Apple is heavily reliant on manufacturing

geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China, and investors will want to know how the business is coping.\n    *   Apple stock has declined more than 30% from its record high four times in the last decade, but it has always rebounded sharply in the following year.\n\n*   **Company Strategy and Developments:**\n    *   Apple is shifting more iPhone production to India to mitigate the impact of tariffs.\n    *   Apple is preparing for the artificial intelligence boom by designing specialized chips and launching artificial intelligence-powered features.\n    *   Apple is actively seeking a new issuer and network operator for its Apple Card.\n    *   Apple may be building artificial intelligence chips with Broadcom.\n\n*   **Broader Market Trends and Comparisons:**\n    *   The S\\&P 500 is experiencing high concentration levels, with the top 10 stocks by market cap underperforming the index.\n    *   The stock market may see significant volatility this week due to key earnings reports from major tech companies like Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft, as well as economic data releases on jobs, gross domestic product, and consumer spending.\n    *   The Magnificent Seven stocks, including Apple, have underperformed the market in 2025.\n    *   The Vanguard High Dividend Yield exchange traded fund is an alternative to the Magnificent Seven tech stocks that have

potential buy during the correction.\n\nIn summary, recent news portrays a mixed outlook for Apple. While the company faces challenges from tariffs, geopolitical tensions, and slowing innovation, analysts also point to its strong brand, large installed base, and growing services revenue as reasons for optimism.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":49},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Conclusion\n\n<span style=\"font-size:18px;\">\nFor now that will have to do. Our Essy has a solid foundation but more could be done to organise metadata. No evaluation or validation has been performed (except fuzzing the prompt). Next steps include restructuring the vector database based on lessons learned. That'll be followed by plotting, multi-modal, and structured output. The last close date (generative) function can be temperamental. In the same way Gemini always feels regarding dates. I've learnt so much. I'm happy I decided to participate in the event! It really has been a joy to see Essy grow from random chat with Gemini into the foundation for a good-broker buddy. I hope you enjoy playing with this edition as much as I enjoyed building it!\n</span>","metadata":{}}]}
