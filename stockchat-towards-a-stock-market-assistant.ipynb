Here's a breakdown of what it is and how it works:\n","\n","*   **What it is:** The stock market is a place where investors buy and sell shares of publicly traded companies. It allows companies to raise money by selling shares (equity) to investors, who then become part owners of the business.\n","*   **How it started:** Originally, it was a place for entrepreneurs to get funding for their businesses. Investors would give money in exchange for shares, making them part owners. Over time, a secondary market developed where investors could sell their shares to others.\n","*   **How it works today:** The stock market is largely electronic, matching buyers and sellers. Companies issue shares to investors in exchange for money. The initial stock price is set before the company goes public through an Initial Public Offering (IPO). After the IPO, shares are traded on exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Nasdaq.\n","*   **Why companies go public:** By offering shares to the public through an IPO, a company can raise significant capital to fund expansion, hire employees, buy equipment, and more.\n","*   **What makes stock prices change:** Stock prices are influenced by factors like the company's sales growth, profit margins, and the overall state of the stock market and economy. Rising earnings per share often lead to increased investor demand, driving the stock price up.\n","*   **Key functions:**\n","    *   **Raising Capital:** It enables companies to raise funds for growth.\n","    *   **Liquidity:** It provides a platform for investors to buy and sell shares easily.\n","    *   **Price Discovery:** It helps determine the fair value of securities through supply and demand.\n","    *   **Economic Indicator:** The stock market's performance is often seen as an indicator of a country's economic health.\n","*   **Primary vs. Secondary Market:**\n","    *   **Primary Market:** This is where new securities are created and sold directly by the company to investors (e.g., during an IPO).\n","    *   **Secondary Market:** This is where existing securities are traded between investors.\n","*   **Market Size:** The global stock market has grown significantly, with the total market capitalization of all publicly traded stocks worldwide rising from US$2.5 trillion in 1980 to US$111 trillion by the end of 2023.\n"],"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>"]},"execution_count":3,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["# This is an accurate retelling of events. \n","config_with_search = types.GenerateContentConfig(\n","    tools=[types.Tool(google_search=types.GoogleSearch())],\n","    temperature=0.0\n",")\n","chat = client.chats.create(\n","    model=project_model, config=config_with_search, history=[]) # Ignoring the part about dark elves, and tengwar.\n","\n","response = chat.send_message('Do you know anything about the stock market?')\n","Markdown(response.text)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ccadd127","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.008878,"end_time":"2025-04-21T06:42:24.119786","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-04-21T06:42:24.110908","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# How much Gemini 2.0 knows\n","\n","<span style=\"font-size:18px;\">\n","I thought to myself: Could grounding really make it that easy?

If you have volume data, add a 'Volume' key to the `data` dictionary and uncomment `volume=True`.\n","*   **Error Handling (Removed):**  I removed the `yf.download` part because the prompt didn't ask for downloading data, just plotting existing data.
