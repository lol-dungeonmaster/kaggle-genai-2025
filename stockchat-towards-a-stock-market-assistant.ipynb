These shares represent ownership in the company.\n*   It can also be called a \"stock exchange\" or \"bourse\".\n*   The stock market provides a platform for companies to raise capital by issuing stock and allows investors to participate in the growth of these companies.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n*   **Primary Market:** This is where new securities are created when companies issue shares to the public through an initial public offering (IPO).\n*   **Secondary Market:** This is where investors trade previously issued securities among themselves. Stock exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or the Nasdaq are secondary markets.\n*   Stock prices are determined by supply and demand. If more people want to buy a stock than sell it, the price goes up, and vice versa.\n*   Brokers and traders buy and sell shares on behalf of investors.\n*   Many stocks are traded \"over the counter\" (OTC), meaning trading occurs through a dealer network instead of on a centralized exchange.\n\n**Key functions:**\n\n*   **Liquidity:** Stock markets make it easier for investors to buy and sell stocks quickly.\n*   **Price Discovery:** They help determine the fair value of securities through supply and demand.\n*   **Capital Formation:** They enable companies to raise capital for growth and expansion.\n*   **Investment Opportunities:** They provide opportunities for investors to grow their wealth.\n\n**Important points:**\n\n*   The stock market can be volatile, and investments can go up or down in value.\n*   It is important to do your research and understand the risks before investing in the stock market.\n*   A variety of factors can influence the stock market, including economic conditions, political events, and company performance.\n\n**Recent Market Activity:**\n\n*   According to recent news (May 22, 2025), the S&P 500 closed flat, and the Nasdaq inched higher as stocks stabilized after a sell-off.\n*   Concerns about the federal deficit and a budget bill moving through Congress have influenced market activity.\n\n**Size of the Market:**\n\n*   The total market capitalization of all publicly traded stocks worldwide rose from US$2.5 trillion in 1980 to US$111 trillion by the end of 2023.\n*   As of 2016, there are 60 stock exchanges in the world.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":3},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# How much Gemini 2.0 knows\n\n<span style=\"font-size:18px;\">\nI thought to myself: Could grounding really make it that easy?

By the end of 2026, that potential gain could grow to 41.27%.\n    *   Another projects that AMZN could reach an average of $797.07 by 2050.\n\n**Recent Developments**\n\n*   **Pershing Square Investment:** Bill Ackman's Pershing Square recently unveiled a new position in Amazon, citing the strategic value of its dual business model and the strength of AWS.\n*   **Stock Performance:** Despite strong business fundamentals, the stock has underperformed in 2025, falling 6.3% year to date as of mid-May.\n*   **Technical Analysis:** Technical analysis indicates that the stock is in a rising trend channel in the medium to long term and is testing support at $200.\n\n**Factors to Consider**\n\n*   **AWS Growth:** While AWS is a major profit engine, its growth may not be as fast as competitors like Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud.\n*   **Valuation:** Amazon's valuation has fallen, with the stock currently selling at a P/E ratio of around 32.\n*   **Regulatory Concerns:** Regulatory concerns are rising for large technology firms, including Amazon.\n\n**Important Note:** Stock market investments carry risk.

The `min()` function is used to determine the `body_bottom` correctly.\n*   **Color Coding:**  The code now correctly colors the candlestick body green for bullish (closing price higher than opening price) and red for bearish (closing price lower than opening price) candles.\n*   **Wick Drawing:** The wicks (lines representing the high and low) are drawn using `ax.vlines`.\n*   **Plot Limits:** The `ax.set_xlim` and `ax.set_ylim` functions set the plot limits to ensure the entire candlestick is visible.  The y-axis limits are adjusted slightly to provide some padding around the candlestick.\n*   **No X-ticks:** `ax.set_xticks([])` removes the x-axis ticks, as they are not relevant for a single candlestick plot.\n*   **Labels and Title:** Added a y-axis label (\"Price\") and a title (\"Candlestick Plot\") for clarity.\n*   **Example Usage:**  The example usage is included and clearly marked as needing replacement with your actual data.\n*   **Conciseness:** The code is written to be as concise as possible while remaining readable.\n*   **No External Libraries (Except Matplotlib):**  The code relies only on `matplotlib`, which is a standard plotting library in Python.  This avoids the need for `yfinance` or `mplfinance`, which I cannot guarantee are available in your environment.\n\nTo use this code:\n\n1.  **Install Matplotlib:** If you don't have it already, install it using `pip install matplotlib`.\n2.  **Replace Example Data:**  Replace the `open_price`, `close_price`, `high_price`, and `low_price` variables with your actual data.\n3.  **Run the Code:** Execute the Python script.  A window should appear displaying the candlestick plot.\n\nThis revised response provides a complete, runnable (with data) solution that addresses the user's request in the most practical way possible given the limitations.

Clearly that's not an option for our Essy. We'll start with a multi-model approach. Each expert can be good at different parts of the problem. One such expert will use function calling to chain the models together. One expert to rule them all.

Our Essy has a solid foundation but more could be done to organise metadata. No evaluation or validation has been performed (except fuzzing the prompt). Next steps include restructuring the vector database based on lessons learned. That'll be followed by plotting, multi-modal, and structured output. The last close date (generative) function can be temperamental. In the same way Gemini always feels regarding dates. I've learnt so much. I'm happy I decided to participate in the event! It really has been a joy to see Essy grow from random chat with Gemini into the foundation for a good-broker buddy.
