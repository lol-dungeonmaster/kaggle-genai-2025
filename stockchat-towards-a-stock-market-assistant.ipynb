Here's some information about the stock market:\n\n**What it is:**\n\n*   The stock market is a place where stocks or shares of publicly traded companies are bought and sold. This transfer of stocks happens between a seller and a buyer, who must agree on a price.\n*   It provides a platform for companies to raise capital by issuing stocks and for investors to own a piece of those companies.\n\n**Key Components:**\n\n*   **Stock Exchanges:** These are exchanges where stockbrokers and traders can buy and sell shares, bonds, and other securities. Examples include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the London Stock Exchange (LSE). Many companies have their stocks listed on these exchanges, which increases the stock's liquidity and attractiveness to investors.\n*   **Market Participants:** These range from small, individual investors to large institutions like banks, insurance companies, pension funds, and hedge funds.\n*   **Market Capitalization:** This refers to the total value of all outstanding shares of a publicly traded company. The total market capitalization of all stocks worldwide was $111 trillion by the end of 2023.\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1.  **Primary Market:** This is where new financial assets are created when companies issue stocks for the first time.\n2.  **Secondary Market:** This is where existing financial assets (stocks that have already been issued) are traded between investors.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   Stock prices are influenced by various factors, including company performance, economic conditions, and investor sentiment.\n*   Investing in the stock market involves risk, and it's possible to lose money.\n*   Factors like trading prices, market ratings, information about stock exchange dynamics, and financial institutions can influence participation in stock markets.\n\n**Stock Market Indexes:**\n\n*   These are used to measure the performance of a group of stocks. Examples include the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite.\n\n**Trends:**\n\n*   The US500 stock market index has decreased by 4.10% since the beginning of 2025.\n\n**Where to Find More Information:**\n\n*   **Google Finance:** Provides stock market prices, real-time quotes, and business news.\n*   **Investor.gov:** Offers educational resources about the stock market.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":3},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# How much Gemini 2.0 knows\n\n<span style=\"font-size:18px;\">\nI thought to myself: Could grounding really make it that easy?

This makes the code more robust.\n*   **`yfinance` for Data:** Uses `yfinance` to download the stock data directly from Yahoo Finance.  This is a reliable and convenient way to get stock data.  It also handles the data download and parsing.\n*   **Concise Data Extraction:**  Uses `.iloc[-1]` to efficiently extract the last values from the DataFrame.\n*   **`period=\"1d\"`:**  Specifies a period of \"1d\" to get only the most recent day's data, which is what we need for the last OHLC values.\n*   **Figure Size:** Sets the figure size using `plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))` to make the plot more readable.\n*   **Grid:** Adds a grid to the plot for easier value reading.\n\nTo use this code:\n\n1.  **Install `yfinance` and `matplotlib`:**\n\n```bash\npip install yfinance matplotlib\n```\n\n2.  **Run the Code:** Copy and paste the code into a Python environment (like a Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or a Python script) and run it.

There are 22 strong buy, 51 buy, and 6 hold recommendations. There are no sell or strong sell recommendations.\n*   The trend in analyst recommendations has been consistently positive over the past few months.\n\n**Sentiment Analysis:**\n\n*   Recent news articles present a mixed sentiment regarding Amazon.\n*   **Positive Sentiments:** Several articles highlight Amazon's strong position in AI, cloud services, and e-commerce, with analysts largely bullish on the company's long-term prospects. Some analysts predict that Amazon could surpass Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple in market valuation within the next 5 years.\n*   **Neutral Sentiments:** Some articles present a mixed outlook, citing both opportunities and risks for Amazon. While the company's cloud and advertising businesses are expected to show growth, the impact of US sanctions and tariffs remains a concern for investors.\n*   **Negative Sentiments:** Several articles discuss the potential negative impact of tariffs on Amazon's business, as a significant portion of products sold on its platform are imported from China. Some articles also mention concerns about a potential slowdown in AI infrastructure demand and the impact of economic uncertainty on Amazon's cloud computing business.\n\n**Short-Term Trends:**\n\n*   **Tariff Concerns:** The potential impact of tariffs on Amazon's business is a significant short-term concern. Tariffs could raise prices on numerous types of goods, including electronics, textiles, and apparel, which could impact Amazon's e-commerce sales.\n*   **AI and Cloud Growth:** Amazon's cloud and advertising segments are expected to show growth, and the company is making significant investments in AI infrastructure.\n*   **Economic Uncertainty:** Concerns about a potential recession and its impact on digital advertising and cloud spending are also weighing on investor sentiment.\n\n**Concise Summary:**\n\nAmazon's recommendation trends are strongly bullish, with a majority of analysts recommending to buy or strongly buy the stock. However, sentiment analysis reveals a mixed outlook, with positive sentiments related to Amazon's strong position in AI, cloud services, and e-commerce, but also negative sentiments related to the potential impact of tariffs and economic uncertainty.
