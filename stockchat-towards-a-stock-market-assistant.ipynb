Here's some information about the stock market:\n\n**General Information**\n*   The stock market facilitates the exchange of stocks or securities between buyers and sellers. This transfer requires an agreement on price between the parties.\n*   Equities, also known as stocks or shares, represent ownership in a company.\n*   The stock market includes a range of participants, from individual investors to large institutions like banks, insurance companies, hedge funds, and pension funds. These participants can be located worldwide.\n*   Orders to buy or sell are typically executed by stock exchange traders.\n\n**Stock Exchanges**\n*   A stock exchange is a marketplace where traders and stockbrokers can buy and sell shares, bonds, and other securities.\n*   Many large companies have their stocks listed on a stock exchange, which increases the stock's liquidity and attractiveness to investors.\n*   A stock exchange can also act as a guarantor of settlement.\n*   Some companies list their stock on multiple exchanges in different countries to attract international investors.\n*   Stocks can also be traded \"over the counter\" (OTC) through a dealer.\n\n**Market Size**\n*   The total market capitalization of all publicly traded stocks worldwide rose from US$2.5 trillion in 1980 to US$111 trillion by the end of 2023.\n*   As of 2016, there were 60 stock exchanges in the world.\n*   In 2021, the value of world stock markets experienced an increase of 26.5%, amounting to US$22.3 trillion.\n\n**Primary and Secondary Markets**\n*   In the primary market, financial assets are created and transmitted directly by their issuer.\n*   In the secondary market, existing financial assets are exchanged.\n\nKeep in mind that the stock market is dynamic and subject to change. For example, the United States Stock Market Index (US500) has decreased by 3.31% since the beginning of 2025.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":3},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# How much Gemini 2.0 knows\n\n<span style=\"font-size:18px;\">\nI thought to myself: Could grounding really make it that easy?

However, I can provide you with the Python code using libraries like `matplotlib` or `plotly` that you can run in your own Python environment (like Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, etc.) to create the candlestick chart.\n\nHere's the Python code using `matplotlib`:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib.dates as mdates\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom mplfinance.original_flavor import candlestick_ohlc\n\n# Data (replace with actual data)\ndata = {\n    'Date': ['2025-04-28', '2025-04-29', '2025-04-30', '2025-05-01', '2025-05-02'],\n    'Open': [32.21, 31.80, 31.46, 30.86, 31.49],\n    'High': [32.21, 31.80, 31.46, 30.86, 32.30],\n    'Low': [32.21, 31.80, 31.46, 30.86, 31.15],\n    'Close': [32.21, 31.80, 31.46, 30.86, 31.97]\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\ndf['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])\ndf['Date'] = df['Date'].apply(mdates.date2num)\n\n# Create the candlestick chart\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\ncandlestick_ohlc(ax, df[['Date', 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close']].values, width=0.6, colorup='green', colordown='red')\n\n# Format the x-axis\ndate_format = mdates.DateFormatter('%Y-%m-%d')\nax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(date_format)\nfig.autofmt_xdate()\n\n# Add labels and title\nax.set_xlabel('Date')\nax.set_ylabel('Price')\nax.set_title('MGM Candlestick Chart (Last Week)')\n\n# Show the chart\nplt.show()\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  **Import Libraries:** Import `matplotlib.pyplot` for plotting, `matplotlib.dates` for handling dates, `pandas` for data manipulation, and `mplfinance` for candlestick chart functionality. If you don't have `mplfinance`, you can install it using `pip install mplfinance`.\n2.  **Data:**  I've created a sample `data` dictionary.  **You MUST replace this with actual data** for the last week's open, high, low, and close prices for MGM.  I've used the data from the search results for demonstration.\n3.  **Create DataFrame:** Convert the dictionary to a Pandas DataFrame.\n4.  **Convert Dates:** Convert the 'Date' column to datetime objects and then to numerical dates that `matplotlib` can use.\n5.  **Create Subplot:** Create a figure and an axes object.\n6.  **Candlestick Chart:** Use `candlestick_ohlc` to create the candlestick chart.\n    *   `ax`: The axes object to plot on.\n    *   `df[['Date', 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close']].values`:  The data in the correct format (Date, Open, High, Low, Close).\n    *   `width`: Width of the candlesticks.\n    *   `colorup`: Color for candlesticks where the closing price is higher than the opening price.\n    *   `colordown`: Color for candlesticks where the closing price is lower than the opening price.\n7.  **Format x-axis:**  Set the date format for the x-axis.\n8.  **Labels and Title:** Add labels to the axes and a title to the chart.\n9.  **Show Chart:** Display the chart.\n\n**To use this code:**\n\n1.  **Install Libraries:**  If you don't have them, install `pandas` and `mplfinance`:\n    ```bash\n    pip install pandas matplotlib mplfinance\n    ```\n2.  **Replace Sample Data:**  **Crucially, replace the sample data in the `data` dictionary with the *actual* open, high, low, and close prices for MGM for the last week.** You can get this data from a financial website like Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, or your brokerage account.\n3.  **Run the Code:**  Run the Python code in your Python environment.  A candlestick chart will be displayed.\n\nThis will give you a basic candlestick chart. You can customize it further by adding volume bars, moving averages, and other technical indicators.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":7},{"cell_type":"code","source":"response = chat.send_message('''Generate some python that plots this last open, close, high, and low.''')\nMarkdown(response.text)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-04T21:25:12.11258Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-04T21:25:12.113036Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-04T21:25:16.856587Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-04T21:25:12.112994Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-04T21:25:16.855232Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":8,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"Okay, I will generate Python code to plot the open, close, high, and low values as a candlestick chart.

You can zoom, pan, and hover over the candlesticks for detailed information.\n*   **Clearer Data Structure:** The data is organized in a dictionary, making it easy to understand and modify.  It's then converted to a Pandas DataFrame, which `plotly` works well with.\n*   **Complete Example:** This is a complete, runnable example.  Just copy and paste it into a Python environment with `plotly` installed.\n*   **Date Handling:** The `plotly` library automatically handles the date formatting, so no explicit date conversion is needed.\n*   **Layout Customization:** The `update_layout` function adds a title and axis labels, and hides the range slider for a cleaner look.  You can customize the layout further.\n*   **Placeholder Data:**  Includes placeholder data.  **You *must* replace this with real data.**\n*   **Conciseness:** The code is more concise and readable.\n\nTo use this code:\n\n1.  **Install `plotly`:** If you don't have it, install it using pip:\n    ```bash\n    pip install plotly pandas\n    ```\n2.  **Replace Placeholder Data:** Replace the sample data in the `data` dictionary with the actual open, high, low, and close prices for MGM.\n3.  **Run the Code:** Run the Python code.

In May 2025, there were 25 \"Buy,\" 14 \"Hold,\" and 3 \"Sell\" ratings, along with 14 \"Strong Buy\" and 0 \"Strong Sell\" ratings.\n\n**News Sentiment:**\nNews sentiment for Apple is also mixed. Some articles highlight positive aspects, such as the company's strong Q2 results, cash generation, and potential for growth in a difficult environment. Other articles point to challenges, including tariff impacts, weaker sales in China, and regulatory headwinds.\n\n**Peer Analysis:**\nTo provide a comparative perspective, an analysis of Apple's peers was conducted. The peers identified were Dell Technologies (DELL), HP Inc (HPQ), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Super Micro Computer Inc (SMCI), NetApp Inc (NTAP), Pure Storage Inc (PSTG), Western Digital Corp (WDC), and IonQ Inc (IONQ).\n\n**Dell Technologies (DELL):**\nAnalyst recommendations for Dell Technologies are generally positive, with a majority of \"Buy\" ratings. Recent news sentiment is also favorable, with many articles highlighting the company's potential to benefit from the AI surge and its strong position in the AI server market.\n\n**HP Inc (HPQ):**\nAnalyst recommendations for HP Inc. are more neutral, with a higher number of \"Hold\" ratings compared to \"Buy\" ratings. Recent news sentiment is mixed, with some articles highlighting positive aspects such as the HP All-In Plan and collaborations with Scuderia Ferrari, while others point to challenges such as tariff risks and declining earnings quality.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   **Apple (AAPL):** The outlook is cautiously optimistic, with positive analyst recommendations but mixed news sentiment due to challenges in China and tariff concerns.\n*   **Dell Technologies (DELL):** The outlook is positive, with favorable analyst recommendations and news sentiment driven by the company's potential to benefit from the AI surge.\n*   **HP Inc (HPQ):** The outlook is neutral, with mixed analyst recommendations and news sentiment reflecting both positive initiatives and potential challenges.\n\nIn conclusion, while Apple faces some headwinds, its strong brand and potential for growth in new areas like AI suggest a positive long-term outlook. Dell Technologies appears well-positioned to benefit from the AI surge, while HP Inc. faces a more uncertain outlook due to mixed analyst sentiment and potential challenges in its core businesses.\n\nThe current date and time is May 4, 2025, at 17:29:38."},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":31},{"cell_type":"code","source":"send_message('''What does the recent news say about Apple and the impact of tariffs?

Our Essy has a solid foundation but more could be done to organise metadata. No evaluation or validation has been performed (except fuzzing the prompt). Next steps include restructuring the vector database based on lessons learned. That'll be followed by plotting, multi-modal, and structured output. The last close date (generative) function can be temperamental. In the same way Gemini always feels regarding dates. I've learnt so much. I'm happy I decided to participate in the event! It really has been a joy to see Essy grow from random chat with Gemini into the foundation for a good-broker buddy.
