These shares represent ownership in the company.\n*   Stock exchanges provide a platform for these transactions. Examples include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the London Stock Exchange (LSE).\n*   The stock market also includes trading in other securities like bonds and derivatives, though derivatives are more often traded \"over the counter\" (OTC).\n\n**How it works:**\n\n*   When you buy a company's stock, you're buying a small piece of that company.\n*   The price of a stock is determined by supply and demand. If more people want to buy a stock than sell it, the price goes up, and vice versa.\n*   Many factors can influence stock prices, including company performance, economic conditions, and investor sentiment.\n\n**Key functions:**\n\n*   **Raising Capital:** Companies can issue stock to raise money for various purposes, such as expanding their operations or investing in new projects.\n*   **Providing Liquidity:** The stock market allows investors to easily buy and sell their shares, providing liquidity.\n*   **Price Discovery:** The stock market helps determine the fair value of companies based on supply and demand.\n\n**Participants:**\n\n*   Individual investors\n*   Institutional investors such as banks, insurance companies, pension funds, and hedge funds.\n\n**Important concepts:**\n\n*   **Market capitalization:** The total value of a company's outstanding shares.\n*   **Stock Market Index:** A measurement of a section of the stock market. Examples include the S&P 500 and the FTSE 100. The US500 has decreased by 5.61% since the beginning of 2025.\n*   **Primary Market:** Where new securities are created and sold by the issuer.\n*   **Secondary Market:** Where existing securities are traded between investors.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":3},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# How much Gemini 2.0 knows\n\n<span style=\"font-size:18px;\">\nI thought to myself: Could grounding really make it that easy?

Our Essy has a solid foundation but more could be done to organise metadata. No evaluation or validation has been performed (except fuzzing the prompt). Next steps include restructuring the vector database based on lessons learned. That'll be followed by plotting, multi-modal, and structured output. The last close date (generative) function can be temperamental. In the same way Gemini always feels regarding dates. I've learnt so much. I'm happy I decided to participate in the event! It really has been a joy to see Essy grow from random chat with Gemini into the foundation for a good-broker buddy. I hope you enjoy playing with this edition as much as I enjoyed building it!\n</span>","metadata":{}}]}
