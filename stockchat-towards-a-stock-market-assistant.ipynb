These shares represent ownership in the company.\n*   It can also be called a stock exchange or bourse.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n*   **Companies issue stock:** Companies sell shares of their stock to raise capital.\n*   **Investors buy and sell:** Investors purchase these shares, hoping the company will perform well and the value of their shares will increase. They can then sell those shares to other investors at a profit.\n*   **Supply and demand:** Stock prices are determined by supply and demand. If more people want to buy a stock than sell it, the price goes up, and vice versa.\n\n**Key functions:**\n\n*   **Capital formation:** It allows companies to raise money to grow their businesses.\n*   **Investment opportunities:** It provides a platform for investors to grow their wealth.\n*   **Economic indicator:** Stock market performance is often seen as an indicator of the health of the overall economy.\n\n**Important concepts:**\n\n*   **Stock Exchanges:** These are organized marketplaces where stocks are bought and sold. Examples include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Nasdaq.\n*   **Market capitalization:** The total value of a company's outstanding shares.\n*   **Indexes:** These track the performance of a group of stocks, providing a snapshot of the market or a sector. Examples include the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

This could impact margins.\n*   **AWS (Amazon Web Services):** AWS is a major profit driver for Amazon. Its growth and performance are closely watched. AWS is also investing heavily in AI.\n*   **AI (Artificial Intelligence):** Amazon is investing heavily in AI, which is expected to benefit its cloud services.\n*   **Earnings Reports:** Amazon's earnings reports, especially AWS performance, can be a catalyst for the stock. The next earnings report is due on May 1, 2025.\n*   **Profitability:** Amazon's net income margin has improved, driven by AWS.\n*   **Revenue Growth:** Amazon has demonstrated solid revenue growth.\n*   **Valuation:** Amazon's P/E ratio has decreased, which some analysts see as an attractive buying opportunity.\n\n**Positive Aspects:**\n\n*   **Dominant Position:** Amazon has a leading position in e-commerce and cloud services.\n*   **Diversification:** Amazon is a diversified company with multiple revenue streams.\n*   **Prime Subscriptions:** Prime subscriptions help retain customers and generate recurring revenue.\n*   **Financial Strength:** Amazon is considered financially sound with a strong balance sheet.\n\n**Risks and Uncertainties:**\n\n*   **Competition:** Amazon faces competition in e-commerce and cloud services.\n*   **Regulation:** Regulatory concerns are rising for large technology firms.\n*   **Economic Slowdown:** A recession could reduce consumer spending and corporate cloud investments.\n\n**Analyst Price Targets:**\n\n*   The average 12-month price target from analysts is around $248.35.\n*   Price targets vary, with some analysts having higher targets (e.g., $287) and others lower (e.g., $195).\n\n**Financials:**\n\n*   **Revenue:** In 2024, Amazon's revenue was $637.96 billion.\n*   **Earnings:** In 2024, earnings were $59.25 billion.\n\n**In summary:** Amazon stock is currently facing some headwinds, including potential tariffs and concerns about slowing profit growth.

A buy signal was issued from a pivot bottom point on April 21, 2025, and it has risen 7.94% since then. Volume is rising along with the price, which is considered a good technical signal.\n*   **Negative Signals:** The stock is in a wide and falling trend in the short term. It's positioned below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, indicating a bearish short-term trend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 40, suggesting it's near oversold territory but not yet at a critical reversal level. The MACD reinforces the bearish momentum.\n*   **Mixed Signals:** The stock holds a buy signal from the short-term Moving Average, but the long-term average holds a general sell signal, giving a more negative forecast.\n*   **Near-Term Forecasts:** One analysis suggests the stock is expected to fall -27.83% during the next 3 months and, with 90% probability, hold a price between $119.09 and $131.79 at the end of this 3-month period. However, if the stock price stays at current levels or higher, this prediction will change positively. Another forecast indicates that Amazon stock could dip to the $157 price range next month and potentially to $141 if it fails to hold its resistance level.\n\n**Bullish Predictions:**\n\n*   **Analyst Sentiment:** Analysts remain bullish about AMZN stock, with a \"Strong Buy\" consensus rating.\n*   **Price Targets:** The average 12-month price target from analysts is $250.2, with a high estimate of $290.\n*   **Long-Term Growth:** In a normal economic environment, Amazon should be able to grow earnings roughly 20% annually over the next five years, potentially leading to a five-year price target in the high-$400s.\n*   **Factors for Growth:** Potential positive factors include the company's growing advertising business, e-commerce dominance, and AI offerings.\n*   **AWS Strength:** Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains highly profitable and a major contributor to operating income.\n\n**Bearish Predictions:**\n\n*   **Tariff Concerns:** Tariffs imposed by the U.S. could negatively impact Amazon, as the company is caught in the crosshairs of trade wars.\n*   **Economic Uncertainty:** Global economic uncertainty is a significant risk for Amazon. A wide-scale economic downturn would hurt Amazon across multiple areas of its business.\n*   **Competition and Regulation:** Amazon faces competition in e-commerce and cloud services, and regulatory concerns are rising for large technology firms.\n*   **Downgrades and Target Cuts:** Some analysts have downgraded Amazon's rating or lowered their price targets, citing concerns about tariff headwinds and aggressive investments in rural delivery infrastructure.\n*   **Short-Term Decline:** One forecast suggests a potential loss of 4.87% in June, indicating a bearish sentiment for the month ahead.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThe outlook for AMZN is mixed.

This prevents the script from crashing if there's a network issue or if the ticker symbol is invalid.  Also checks if the downloaded data is empty.\n*   **Date Range:**  Calculates the date range dynamically to always get the last 7 days of data, including the current date.  Crucially, it converts the `datetime` objects to strings in the `YYYY-MM-DD` format that `yfinance` expects.\n*   **Clearer Candlestick Plotting:**  The candlestick plotting logic is now more explicit and easier to understand.  It iterates through each row of the data and plots the candlestick body and wicks separately.\n*   **Candlestick Width:**  Introduces `width` and `width2` variables to control the thickness of the candlestick body and wicks, respectively.  This allows for better visual customization.\n*   **Color Coding:**  The code now correctly colors the candlesticks green for upward price movement (close >= open) and red for downward movement (close < open).\n*   **Plot Formatting:**  The plot is formatted with a title, axis labels, grid lines, and rotated x-axis labels for better readability.  `plt.tight_layout()` is added to prevent labels from overlapping.\n*   **Clearer Comments:**  The code is well-commented to explain each step.\n*   **Function Definition:** Encapsulated the plotting logic within a function `plot_candlestick(ticker)` for better organization and reusability.\n*   **`header_visible = False`:** Added to remove the header from the plot.\n*   **Corrected Date Handling:** The most important fix is the correct handling of dates for the `yfinance` API.  It now uses `strftime('%Y-%m-%d')` to format the dates as strings in the required format.\n*   **Pandas Iteration:** Uses `data.iterrows()` for correct iteration over the Pandas DataFrame.\n\nTo use this code:\n\n1.  **Install Libraries:**\n    ```bash\n    pip install yfinance matplotlib pandas\n    ```\n2.  **Run the Code:**\n    *   Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `candlestick_chart.py`) and run it from your terminal:\n        ```bash\n        python candlestick_chart.py\n        ```\n\nThis will generate a candlestick chart for AMZN stock for the last 7 trading days.  The chart will show the open, close, high, and low prices for each day, with green candlesticks indicating upward price movement and red candlesticks indicating downward price movement.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":8},{"cell_type":"code","source":"response = chat.send_message('''What was the last open,close,high,low data for AMZN again?''')\nMarkdown(response.text)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-25T05:15:21.54514Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-25T05:15:21.545434Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-25T05:15:23.542765Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-25T05:15:21.545404Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-25T05:15:23.541544Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":9,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"Okay, here's the AMZN (Amazon) stock data for April 24, 2025:\n\n*   **Open:** \\$180.93\n*   **Close:** \\$186.54\n*   **High:** \\$186.74\n*   **Low:** \\$180.18\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":9},{"cell_type":"code","source":"response = chat.send_message(\n    '''What is AMZN open,close,high,low data for the past month? \n    Present the data with multiple columns for display in markdown.''')\nMarkdown(response.text)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-25T05:15:23.544721Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-25T05:15:23.545178Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-25T05:15:29.6224Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-25T05:15:23.545132Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-25T05:15:29.621157Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":10,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"I am unable to retrieve the exact data for the past month.

Clearly that's not an option for our Essy. We'll start with a multi-model approach. Each expert can be good at different parts of the problem. One such expert will use function calling to chain the models together. One expert to rule them all.

Our Essy has a solid foundation but more could be done to organise metadata. No evaluation or validation has been performed (except fuzzing the prompt). Next steps include restructuring the vector database based on lessons learned. That'll be followed by plotting, multi-modal, and structured output. The last close date (generative) function can be temperamental. In the same way Gemini always feels regarding dates. I've learnt so much. I'm happy I decided to participate in the event! It really has been a joy to see Essy grow from random chat with Gemini into the foundation for a good-broker buddy.
