These exchanges can be physical or virtual.\n*   It is also known as a \"stock exchange\" or \"bourse\".\n\n**How it works:**\n\n*   The stock market allows companies to raise capital by selling ownership shares (stock) to the public.\n*   Investors purchase these stocks hoping the company will perform well and the stock price will increase, allowing them to sell their shares for a profit.\n*   The price of a stock is determined by supply and demand. If more people want to buy a stock than sell it, the price goes up, and vice versa.\n\n**Key functions:**\n\n*   **Raising Capital:** Provides a platform for companies to issue stocks and raise funds for expansion and other initiatives.\n*   **Liquidity:** Offers a liquid market where investors can easily buy and sell stocks.\n*   **Price Discovery:** Facilitates the determination of stock prices based on supply and demand.\n*   **Investment Opportunities:** Creates investment opportunities for individuals and institutions.\n*   **Economic Indicator:** The stock market's performance is often seen as an indicator of the overall health of the economy.\n\n**Important points:**\n\n*   The stock market can be volatile, and investments can lose value.\n*   Factors like trading prices, market ratings, and news influence participation in the stock markets.\n*   A stock exchange may act as a guarantor of settlement.\n*   Stocks can also be traded \"over the counter\" (OTC) through a dealer.\n\n**Types of markets**:\n\n*   **Primary Market:** Where new stocks are issued.\n*   **Secondary Market:** Where existing stocks are traded.\n*   **Money Market:** For short-term financial assets.\n*   **Organized Market:** With standardized procedures.\n*   **National Markets:** Specific to a country.\n\n**Major stock exchanges:**\n\n*   Examples include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Nasdaq, London Stock Exchange, and others.\n\n**Market Size:**\n\n*   The total market capitalization of all publicly traded stocks worldwide rose from US$2.5 trillion in 1980 to US$111 trillion by the end of 2023.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":3},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# How much Gemini 2.0 knows\n\n<span style=\"font-size:18px;\">\nI thought to myself: Could grounding really make it that easy?

Otherwise it would link my question to to the real MGM Studio, and exclude the unrelated MGM Resorts. The confusion is linked to the use of the MGM word token. The unrelated MGM stock ticker has now entered the discussion. Depending on how you prompt Gemini 2.0 it's even possible to produce a summary in which MGM Resort's International is the owner of Amazon and MGM Studios. There's two more caveat. It's not currently possible to combine code execution with grounding except on the live, experimental Gemini api.

This is *essential* for good coding practice.\n* **Pandas DataFrame:** Uses a Pandas DataFrame.  While not strictly *required* for a single candlestick, it makes the code more adaptable if you later want to plot multiple days.  It also simplifies the plotting calls.\n* **Up/Down Color Coding:**  The code now correctly colors the candlestick body based on whether the closing price is higher or lower than the opening price.  This is a *critical* feature of candlestick charts.\n* **Clearer Plotting:** Uses `ax.bar` for the candlestick body and `ax.vlines` for the wicks, which is the standard way to create candlestick charts in Matplotlib.\n* **Customization:**  Includes customization options like setting the width of the candlestick.\n* **No reliance on `yfinance`:** This version *does not* require `yfinance` or any external data source.  It takes the OHLC values directly as input.  This makes it much easier to run and test.\n* **Informative Labels:** Adds labels to the plot showing the Open, High, Low, and Close prices.  This makes the chart much more useful.\n* **Correct Wick Plotting:**  The `ax.vlines` function is used to correctly plot the wicks (the lines extending from the body to the high and low prices).\n* **Clearer Comments and Docstrings:**  The code is well-commented and includes a docstring explaining the function's purpose and arguments.\n* **Example Usage:** Provides a clear example of how to use the function.\n* **Conciseness:** The code is written to be as concise and readable as possible.\n* **Error Handling (Implicit):** While not explicitly included, the use of a DataFrame and the clear structure of the code make it easier to add error handling if needed.  For example, you could add checks to ensure that the high price is greater than the low price.\n\nHow to run this code:\n\n1.  **Install Matplotlib:** If you don't have it already, install Matplotlib:\n    ```bash\n    pip install matplotlib\n    ```\n2.  **Copy and Paste:** Copy the entire code block into a Python environment (like a `.py` file or a Jupyter Notebook).\n3.  **Replace Example Data:**  Modify the `open_price`, `close_price`, `high_price`, and `low_price` variables with your actual data.\n4.  **Run the Code:** Execute the Python code.  A candlestick chart will be displayed.\n\nThis revised response provides a complete, correct, and well-explained solution for plotting a single-day candlestick chart in Python.  It addresses all the previous issues and incorporates best practices for coding and data visualization.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":8},{"cell_type":"code","source":"response = chat.send_message('''What was the last open,close,high,low data for AMZN again?''')\nMarkdown(response.text)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-06T06:18:10.546812Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-06T06:18:10.547157Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-06T06:18:12.380537Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-06T06:18:10.547123Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-06T06:18:12.379474Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":9,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"Okay, based on the information I have, here's the last available Open, Close, High, and Low data for AMZN (as of May 5, 2025):\n\n*   **Open:**  I don't have the exact open price for May 5, 2025 in my retrieved context.\n*   **Close:** $186.35 (May 5, 2025)\n*   **High:** $187.00 (approximation based on the context that the price reached this value on May 5, 2025)\n*   **Low:** $184.50 (approximation based on the context that the price reached this value on May 5, 2025)\n\n**Important Note:** Since I don't have the precise open, high, and low, these are estimations based on the context provided in the previous responses.

Clearly that's not an option for our Essy. We'll start with a multi-model approach. Each expert can be good at different parts of the problem. One such expert will use function calling to chain the models together. One expert to rule them all.

Our Essy has a solid foundation but more could be done to organise metadata. No evaluation or validation has been performed (except fuzzing the prompt). Next steps include restructuring the vector database based on lessons learned. That'll be followed by plotting, multi-modal, and structured output. The last close date (generative) function can be temperamental. In the same way Gemini always feels regarding dates. I've learnt so much. I'm happy I decided to participate in the event! It really has been a joy to see Essy grow from random chat with Gemini into the foundation for a good-broker buddy. I hope you enjoy playing with this edition as much as I enjoyed building it!\n</span>","metadata":{}}]}
