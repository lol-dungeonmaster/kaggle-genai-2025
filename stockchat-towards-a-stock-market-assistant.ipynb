This is crucial for more complex plotting tasks.\n*   **Color Determination:**  The code now correctly determines the candlestick color based on whether the closing price is higher or lower than the opening price.  Green (or lime) for an increase, red (or firebrick) for a decrease.\n*   **Wick and Body Plotting:**  Uses `ax.vlines` to correctly plot the candlestick body and wicks.  This is the standard way to draw these elements.  `vlines` is used because candlesticks are vertical.\n*   **Price Annotations:** Added annotations to display the open, close, high, and low prices directly on the plot for clarity.  This makes the plot much more informative.\n*   **Plot Limits:**  The `ax.set_ylim` line now includes padding to prevent the candlestick from touching the top or bottom of the plot, improving visual appeal.\n*   **No X-Axis Ticks:**  `ax.set_xticks([])` removes the x-axis ticks, as this is a single-day candlestick and the x-axis would be meaningless.\n*   **Concise Comments:**  Comments explain each section of the code.\n*   **`matplotlib.pyplot`:** Uses the standard `matplotlib.pyplot` interface, which is almost universally available.\n*   **Correctness:** The most important improvement is that the plot now *correctly* represents the candlestick based on the provided data.  The previous versions had errors in how the body and wicks were drawn.\n*   **Example Usage:** The example usage is included and uses the data from the previous response, making it easy to run.\n*   **Docstring:** Includes a docstring to explain the function's purpose and arguments.\n\nHow to run this code:\n\n1.  **Save:** Save the code as a `.py` file (e.g., `candlestick.py`).\n2.  **Run:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run it using `python candlestick.py`.\n\nThis will generate a candlestick plot showing the open, close, high, and low prices for AMZN on May 12, 2025.  The color of the candlestick will indicate whether the price increased or decreased during the day.  The wicks will show the high and low prices relative to the open and close.  The annotations will display the exact price values.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":11},{"cell_type":"code","source":"response = chat.send_message('''What was the last open,close,high,low data for AMZN again?''')\nMarkdown(response.text)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-13T08:51:46.511674Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-13T08:51:46.511964Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-13T08:51:47.303395Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-13T08:51:46.511935Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-13T08:51:47.302413Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":12,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"Based on the information I provided earlier, the last open, close, high, and low data for AMZN (Amazon) from May 12, 2025, is as follows:\n\n*   **Open:** $210.67\n*   **Close:** $208.64\n*   **High:** $211.66\n*   **Low:** $205.84\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":12},{"cell_type":"code","source":"response = chat.send_message(\n    '''What is AMZN open,close,high,low data for the past month? \n    Present the data with multiple columns for display in markdown.''')\nMarkdown(response.text)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-13T08:51:47.307479Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-13T08:51:47.307781Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-13T08:51:53.452218Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-13T08:51:47.30775Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-13T08:51:53.451238Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":13,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"Here's the AMZN (Amazon) stock data for the past month (approximately April 13, 2025, to May 12, 2025).\n\n| Date       | Open    | High    | Low     | Close   |\n|------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| May 11, 2025 | 210.71  | 211.66  | 205.75  | 208.64  |\n| May 08, 2025 | 193.38  | 194.69  | 191.16  | 193.06  |\n| May 07, 2025 | 191.43  | 194.33  | 188.82  | 192.08  |\n| May 06, 2025 | 185.56  | 190.99  | 185.01  | 188.71  |\n| May 05, 2025 | 184.57  | 187.93  | 183.85  | 185.01  |\n| May 04, 2025 | 186.51  | 188.18  | 185.53  | 186.35  |\n| May 01, 2025 | 191.43  | 192.88  | 186.40  | 189.98  |\n| Apr 30, 2025 | 190.63  | 191.81  | 187.50  | 190.20  |\n| Apr 29, 2025 | 182.17  | 185.05  | 178.85  | 184.42  |\n| Apr 28, 2025 | 183.99  | 188.02  | 183.68  | 187.39  |\n| Apr 27, 2025 | 190.10  | 190.22  | 184.88  | 187.70  |\n| Apr 24, 2025 | 187.62  | 189.94  | 185.49  | 188.99  |\n| Apr 23, 2025 | 180.91  | 186.74  | 180.18  | 186.54  |\n| Apr 22, 2025 | 183.45  | 187.38  | 180.19  | 180.60  |\n| Apr 21, 2025 | 169.85  | 176.78  | 169.35  | 173.18  |\n| Apr 20, 2025 | 169.60  | 169.60  | 165.29  | 167.32  |\n| Apr 16, 2025 | 176.00  | 176.21  | 172.00  | 172.61  |\n| Apr 15, 2025 | 176.29  | 179.10  | 171.41  | 174.33  |\n| Apr 14, 2025 | 181.41  | 182.35  | 177.93  | 179.59  |\n| Apr 13, 2025 | 186.84  | 187.44  | 179.23  | 182.12  |\n\n**Disclaimer:** This data is based on information available as of May 13, 2025, and may be subject to change.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":13},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<span style=\"font-size:18px;\">\nThe second caveat is a lack of access to realtime data.

Clearly that's not an option for our Essy. We'll start with a multi-model approach. Each expert can be good at different parts of the problem. One such expert will use function calling to chain the models together. One expert to rule them all.

For the Chroma embedding function we'll use <code>models/text-embedding-004</code> due to it's 1500 request-per-minute quota. We'll need to be mindful of the smaller 2,048 token input.

Our Essy has a solid foundation but more could be done to organise metadata. No evaluation or validation has been performed (except fuzzing the prompt). Next steps include restructuring the vector database based on lessons learned. That'll be followed by plotting, multi-modal, and structured output. The last close date (generative) function can be temperamental. In the same way Gemini always feels regarding dates. I've learnt so much. I'm happy I decided to participate in the event! It really has been a joy to see Essy grow from random chat with Gemini into the foundation for a good-broker buddy. I hope you enjoy playing with this edition as much as I enjoyed building it!\n</span>","metadata":{}}]}
