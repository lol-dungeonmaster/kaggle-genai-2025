Our Essy has a solid foundation but more could be done to organise metadata. No evaluation or validation has been performed (except fuzzing the prompt). Next steps include restructuring the vector database based on lessons learned. That'll be followed by plotting, multi-modal, and structured output. The last close date (generative) function can be temperamental. In the same way Gemini always feels regarding dates. I've learnt so much. I'm happy I decided to participate in the event! It really has been a joy to see Essy grow from random chat with Gemini into the foundation for a good-broker buddy. I hope you enjoy playing with this edition as much as I enjoyed building it!\n","</span>"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"day-2-document-q-a-with-rag.ipynb","toc_visible":true},"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[{"sourceId":97258,"sourceType":"competition"},{"datasetId":7122584,"sourceId":11376588,"sourceType":"datasetVersion"}],"dockerImageVersionId":30786,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.14"},"papermill":{"default_parameters":{},"duration":149.598045,"end_time":"2025-04-21T05:54:51.032456","environment_variables":{},"exception":null,"input_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","output_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","parameters":{},"start_time":"2025-04-21T05:52:21.434411","version":"2.6.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
